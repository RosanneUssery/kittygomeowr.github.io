<h1>To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized.</h1>

<p>Math.random is the way we generate random numbers to use in Java. The return type of the .random method is any number greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0. In order to generate larger or smaller numbers, Math.random should be multiplied by the factor necessary to obtain that number. 
"Math" is capitalized because it defines a static class that lets the program know that it's going to be using a utility class with mathematical constants <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7486012/static-classes-in-java">(1)</a>. This serves as an overall declaration of how the program will run and what libraries it will use <a href = "http://www.dummies.com/programming/java/what-is-the-static-keyword-in-java/">(2)</a>. These are functions that often don't need to be applied directly to an object and can be used as a utility within the program <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/576228/why-are-the-methods-of-the-math-class-static"> (3)</a>. </p>
