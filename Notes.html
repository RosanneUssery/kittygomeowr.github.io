	<h1>Headings serve to introduce and title text </h1>
	<p>Paragraphs denote the paragraph style and should be kept readable</p>
	<p>Unordered lists:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make it easy to separate out information</li>
		<li>Have neat bullet points</li>
		<li>Make things tidy and awesome</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Ordered lists:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Give you pretty numbers</li>

	</ol>
	<a href = "https://www.wikipedia.org/" target = "blank">
		This is a link to Wikipedia. Yay!</a>
	<p>The target = "blank" function tells the browser to open the link in a new tab.</p>
	<p>To add an image, img src is how it's done. Give the url of the image,
		then close it with a slash and we're good to go!</p>
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Madeleine_Paris.jpg" />
	<p> The "alt" attribute gives a description of the image in case it doesn't load or
		for visually impaired people. If the image isn't pertinent to the topic at hand tho,
		alt isn't necessary. </p>
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/A_classic_circular_form_spider%27s_web.jpg
		alt = "A classic circular form spider web" />
	<p> The image can also be a link! Just wrap it in a a href.</p>

		<p>Border Styles have the following types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>solid - border is a solid line.</li>
			<li>dashed - border is a series of lines or dashes.</li>
			<li>dotted - border is a series of square dots.</li>
			<li>double - border is two solid black lines.</li>
			<li>groove - border is a groove (or carving).</li>
			<li>inset - border appears to cut into the screen.</li>
			<li>outset - border appears to pop out of the screen.</li>
			<li>ridge - border appears as a picture frame.</li>
			<li>hidden or none - no border.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Border widths (in addition to being denoted in px) can also be thin, medium, 
			thick, but is usually in px. They can also be modified to have different widths 
			(in px) around the box (clockwise: top, right, bottom, left). Finally, they 
			can also use border-top-width/border-right-width/border-bottom-width/
			border-left-width to modify the borders more specifically.</p>
