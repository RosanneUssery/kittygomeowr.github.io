		<p>I am studying to be an IT professional specializing in full stack development. I am attending <a href = "http://skilldistillery.com/" target = "blank">Skill Distillery</a> to learn the skills I need to get ahead in a new career.</p>
		<p>Programming appealed to me because I enjoy learning how spoken languages work, and from what I have seen of programming languages, I am excited to learn more of their  symmetry. I am finding that programming languages are beautiful ways of speaking to the world and translating tools into user experiences.</p>
		<p>My goal is to become a lifetime learner and an expert in my field. I want to learn how to craft elegant solutions to problems and find new ways to develop the online world. I am excited to learn new things and to grow as a person. I would also like to leverage my master's degree in creative writing to be able to not only program, but also create easy to understand guides to processes and protocols. I can definitely see myself being both a tech writer and a programmer.</p>
		</p>I have always enjoyed peeling back the curtain to see how things work. Being able to manipulate the software universe and build new and beautiful things appeals to me, especially since the tools are there for the taking. Languages are arcane, but they are not unapproachable for people who have a grasp of logic and symmetry. I believe I am one of those people and I am looking forward to seeing what I can learn and accomplish as a computer programmer.</p>

    <h1>Here's what I've learned so far!</h1>
    <ul>
    	<li><a href = "/switchifelse.html" target = "blank">What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?</a></li>
		<li><a href = "/javaequals.html" target = "blank">When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</a></li>
		<li><a href = "/randommath.html" target = "blank">To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized?</a></li>
		<li><a href = "/castingdoubles" target = "blank">What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</a></li>
		<li><a href = "/dowhile" target = "blank"> What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?</a></li>
