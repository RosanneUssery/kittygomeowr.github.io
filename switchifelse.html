<h1>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?</h1>

<p>Switch cases are used to sort through a series of values within a variable to find matches. Once these matches are defined, the program can use the switch command to sort through them to match values to other values given certain parameters defined within the code. In addition, it determines which cases have to be executed, rather than checking which case is satisfied <a href = "https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-switch-and-if-else-statements-Which-is-better-in-different-cases-Why#!n=12">(1)</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, "if/else" statements are used to determine whether Boolean conditions can be fulfilled. They use a "true/false" methodology to compare inputs and determine whether the condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the if can be run, if it is fase, the else is run. </p>

<p>Using the if/else would be most useful in determining the status between two alternatives, and using Boolean methodologies to determine logic functions. Switch would be the most useful when dealing with multiple factors and also tends to be faster due to the simplicity of its structure <a href = "http://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/198">(2)</a>
